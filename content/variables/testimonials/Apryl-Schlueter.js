I made great connections with so many top-notch and friendly people from different walks of life, the events and talks are infused with SO much fun, and I left wholeheartedly inspired and ready to take action on everything I learned. I still constantly interact with people I've met there, and I find comfort in the thought that I have a supportive family that spans the globe.",
