**Jodi Ettenberg** knew ever since she watched a PBS documentary about the Trans-Siberian trains in the mid-1990s that she wanted to travel to faraway places. After working as a lawyer for five years to save up money for travel, Jodi quit her job and embarked upon a trip around the world. Three years later, she has traipsed through South America, Siberia, Mongolia, China and a good swath of Southeast Asia, with no plans to stop anytime soon.

Throughout, Jodi has blogged about her misadventures on local transportation, her obsessive love of street food and the politics of the places she visits. She currently works as a freelance writer (while trying to eat as much sticky rice as possible).
