**Shaun King** is a journalist, a humanitarian, an activist, and the Senior Justice Writer for the _New York Daily News_. Today, there are crucial conversations rippling across North America—conversations happening on social media, on campuses, in the streets and around dinner tables. In greater numbers, people are talking about real empowerment and liberation for historically disadvantaged groups.

When it comes to the Black Lives Matter movement, they’re talking specifically about human dignity for African Americans. And for this movement, Shaun is amongst the most compelling voices: a humane and passionate advocate for justice and families, and an extremely visible fundraiser for victims of brutality and discrimination. His latest project is the [Injustice Boycott](http://www.injusticeboycott.com/).
