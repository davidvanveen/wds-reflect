    ## At a WDS Academy
    At a WDS Academy, you might learn how to travel hack your way to the dream trip you&apos;ve always wanted to take, discover the science behind happiness, or begin building greater community. You&apos;ll have the opportunity to learn something new to help you live your own remarkable life story. It&apos;s a great way to lead into the main events of the WDS weekend and keep the conversations going after.
