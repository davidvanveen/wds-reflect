    ## Introducing the WDS Hotel™
    Community has always been at the heart of WDS. Every year, many attendees forge lasting friendships and find creative ways to stay together during the weekend before they return home. 
    
    <p>One of the most frequent requests we receive is a way to centralize the process of group accommodations. Well, we can’t be a matchmaker… but we have reserved <i>an entire hotel</i> for the final four days of WDS 2017.</p>
    
    <p>This hotel, known during non-WDS times as the Society Hotel, consists of one large room with shared bunks (hostel style, but nice) <i>and</i> a number of private rooms, including suites. Want to be the life of the party? Book a bunk. Need your space? Choose one of the rooms or suites.</p>
    
    <p>If you love the community of WDS, you’ll love the WDS Hotel™. It’s a sleepover party with 100 of your closest friends.</p>

      Community, Adventure, and Service: for one week you’ll be surrounded by like-minded people interested in pursuing big dreams and building a better world.  
      When you spend WDS with us in Portland, you’ll help us take over the city. With main-stage keynotes, hundreds of attendee-led meetups, dozens of workshops known as “Academies,” adventure activities, two big parties, and hundreds of new friends high-fiving you on street corners, it’s a truly immersive and awesome experience.
      Everyone who comes to WDS is a big part of everything that happens. Our attendees make the community strong and independent with no corporate sponsorships.

      Attendee-led meetups have been a staple of WDS since our first year. In 2017, they're back and better than ever!
      Each day, there will be time set aside for attendees to host these informal meetups, and on any given day, you can go from a meetup for star gazing to a meetup for creative entrepreneurs—and then over to a meetup for a group of people interested in the Tiny House Movement, where a fight will likely break out over who owns the fewest things.
      Meetups aren't led by WDS team members—they're led by your fellow attendees! Our attendee-only app will guide you to your choice of meetups happening all over town from morning to night.    
      And if you have your own audience, you can host a meetup too. (Our dedicated attendee web app will tell you where each meetup is being held.)

      WDS is now a week-long gathering bringing together some of the most remarkable people from around the world. This means we have all-new activities and mini-events to create even more incredible memories together.
      From an Opening Party that gives you a chance to meet the team, speakers, and other attendees, all the way through to an epic Closing Party, we’ve crafted a wonderfully immersive experience. 
      Join your fellow attendees at your choice of extracurricular activities around town—from film screenings and river cruises, to world record attempts and more!

      Part of what makes WDS so great is our weekend of main stage events. Our keynote speakers are bestselling authors, leading activists, and in-demand storytellers. Since our very first year in 2011, the lineup has been inclusive, multicultural, and representative of our whole community. 
      Over the weekend, each speaker will share a short message that combines personal stories with practical ideas on our main stag, but most speakers stick around for the entire weekend and are available for informal conversation.  Sunday afternoon—before we all head to the afterparty—we've set aside a space for our speakers to sign books and meet readers. Print books will be available for sale throughout the weekend, and if you're digital-only, you can stop by to say hi to your favorite author!
