    ## Introducing the WDS Hotel™
    Community has always been at the heart of WDS. Every year, many attendees forge lasting friendships and find creative ways to stay together during the weekend before they return home. 
    
    <p>One of the most frequent requests we receive is a way to centralize the process of group accommodations. Well, we can’t be a matchmaker… but we have reserved <i>an entire hotel</i> for the final four days of WDS 2017.</p>
    
    <p>This hotel, known during non-WDS times as the Society Hotel, consists of one large room with shared bunks (hostel style, but nice) <i>and</i> a number of private rooms, including suites. Want to be the life of the party? Book a bunk. Need your space? Choose one of the rooms or suites.</p>
    
    <p>If you love the community of WDS, you’ll love the WDS Hotel™. It’s a sleepover party with 100 of your closest friends.</p>

      ## WDS Hotel™ FAQs
    You might have some questions. We've got some answers.
     ##### What is the refund and transfer policy?
   WDS Hotel™ packages are non-refundable. Transfers can be made to another attendee for a $50 fee per transfer until June 10th. Contact the WDS concierge team at concierge@wds.fm to request a transfer.
   ##### How do I add additional nights before and/or after the WDS package dates?
    Once you've reserved your WDS Hotel™ package please contact the Society Hotel directly to setup any additional dates by calling (503)445-0444.
     ##### Can I book a partial stay or split days with a friend?
    Once you've booked the room it's your reservation and responsibility regarding who stays with you. But fair warning - if you're friend charges 20 coffees to the room, you'd be responsible for paying it. 
     ##### Can I book a private room with another person who isn’t attending WDS?
    Ideally we'd love for everyone staying at the WDS Hotel™ to be part of WDS. That being said we would understand if you had a significant other or dependent staying with you that isn't coming to WDS (but we hope they would).
    ##### What kinds of facilities are in the hotel?
    There is an excellent cafe + lounge in the lobby area featuring fresh pastries, sandwhiches, and salads. For beverages the cafe features coffee, beer, and wine from some of Portland’s finest and handcrafted cocktails. Additionally, all guests have access to the amazing rooftop lounge. Please note there is not a fitness center onsite. 
    ##### How far is the hotel from the WDS Main Stage?
    The hotel is less than a mile (0.8) walk through downtown. Alternative ways to get there would be by bike, the light rail (MAX) system, or ride share.
