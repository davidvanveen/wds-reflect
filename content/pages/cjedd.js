    ## WDS + Portland
    ##### Connect with Other Leaders and Gamechangers?
Since our first year we’ve recognize how special our hometown of Portland is and have been trying to make stronger connections with our local community. We love that people travel great distances to be here, but we also know that Portland (and our surrounding communities) boast some incredibly talented world-changers. We’d like to give you the opportunity to meet with other folks who are doing amazing things from around the country and the world, and give them the opportunity to meet you.

Specifically, we want to give local leaders like you the chance to think through your challenges in an unconventional way, to brainstorm new ideas for solving issues you’re working on, and to meet people that may be able to help you along your way. It’s a way to help support individuals in our community and as well as to more broadly lift up the area that our entire team also calls home. By waiving the standard ticket price of $647 for you, we hope that you’ll considering being a part of our community. 
Apply below to  join us in learning from unconventional thinkers, acquiring powerful new skills, and gaining an all-new community of friends and supporters. If you still have questions or want to know more email Tina at tinahartpdx@gmail.com.
