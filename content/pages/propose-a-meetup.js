      Make WDS Awesome! Propose a Meetup.
    </h2>
    The goal of WDS has always been to bring amazing people together who believe in and live out the core values of Community, Adventure, and Service.  For the past 5 years, attendee-led meetups have been an integral part of the WDS experience and the best way for us as a community to learn from each other.
    {' '}

    Here are the goals of meetups:

    - Help each other in our pursuits to live remarkable lives
    - Learn and discover
    - Make new connections within the WDS community
    - Do something fun and memorable together

    As an attendee, you have the opportunity to host meetups, attend meetups, or do both using our online system and mobile app.

    ## When Should I Host a Meetup?
    Here is a list of the best times to host an attendee meet up that don’t conflict with WDS programming:

    <table className="time-table">
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>Tuesday, August 9th</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Wednesday, August 10th</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Thursday, August 11th</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Friday, August 12th</td><td>Before 8am, 4:30pm-6pm</td></tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Saturday, August 13th</td>
          <td>Before 8am, 1pm - 3pm, any time after 7pm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>Sunday, August 14th</td><td>Before 8am, 1pm - 3pm</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Monday, August 15th</td><td>Any time</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    ## How to Host a Meetup
    Want to host an adventure, hang out or something in between during this year's World Domination Summit? Here’s what you need to do:

    <div style={{ padding: '0 32px' }}>
      <p>
        1. Before you propose a meetup, use this information to help you organize a successful event: WDS Meetup Guidelines - Create the Best Meetup Ever!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        (Helpful hint: The chances of your meetup getting approved goes up astronomically if you read and use this document)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style={{ padding: '0 32px' }}>
      <p>
        2. Complete the form below with the details on what you have planned. We'll review your proposal and get back to you shortly.
      </p>
    </div>
    Once your proposal is accepted, it will be listed in our official directory of WDS meetups and made available to all the attendees once the WDS App goes live.
