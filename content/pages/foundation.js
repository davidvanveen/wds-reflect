    ## The WDS Foundation
    The WDS Foundation seeks to put the right resources in the hands of amazing people who are acting on the three core values of WDS—community, adventure, and service.

    We do this by providing what we call "Scholarships For Real Life." The goal of these scholarships is to empower individuals to pursue their dreams and impact their community.

    Have a crazy project you want to bring to life? Want to take a trip around the earth and share what you learned with the world? Trying to build something that’s a bit out of your reach? Whatever it is, the WDS Foundation can help fund it. We look for inspiring projects that will improve your life and make the world a better place.

        ## Emily Wray

        One of the cornerstones of the World Domination Summit is adventure, and WDS attendees certainly know how to celebrate living unconventionally. Many of us are driven by the journey, and enjoy striking out on our own in search of new opportunities and experiences. Yet, we also know and appreciate the value of community—having someone to share the ups and downs of our journey and to help us reflect on what we’ve learned. It is this combination of adventure and community that brings us back each July for the World Domination Summit, and also the motivation for this blog post.opportunity to learn something new to help you live your own remarkable life story. It's a great way to lead into the main events of the WDS weekend and keep the conversations going after.
