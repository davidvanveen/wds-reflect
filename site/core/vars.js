On an afternoon walk, Bob came across an old mill that, as luck would have it, had a big sign out front reading “for sale”. In just a few short months, he was grinding flours and cereals for local customers. Bob spent many years growing the business, which is currently located in Milwaukie, Oregon in a 320,000 square foot facility covering some seventeen acres and producing thousands of products.\nBob’s 81st birthday was particularly special.
