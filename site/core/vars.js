I will do so no longer. I will accept nothing less than surrounding myself with people like this throughout my life.

I have a notebook full of quotes and ah-has from the weekend, but what I experienced was belonging. It was someone buying me a donut without me asking. It was dancing like a full-out goober with a couple hundred people. It was knowing shared laughter at things you know other people just wouldn't get. It was happily sharing meals with people who would not otherwise spend time together. It was 1,000 people standing in unison, without hesitation, when asked to donate their birthdays to charity. It was insta-friend. Just because you were there. When was the last time you truly felt like you belonged?","link":"http://www.withlaurasimms.com/blog/world-domination-summit-a-moment-you-missed","photo":"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565aee11e4b06b23bf2b35da/t/565d8cd3e4b04b21693479e9/1448971476880/Career+Coach+Laura+Simms?format=500w","path":"laura__simms"},{"name":"Rita Chand","content":"Both the speakers and the attendees that I met were not only creative and smart, coming from all walks of life, all age groups, all races, all backgrounds, but they were also generous with their thoughts.

The beauty of WDS isn’t the programming, or the venues (which are amazing), or the “networking” like at most conferences. The beauty is that there are several thousand people all gathered in one place, centered on one ideal. The encouragement could be scooped out of the air with a spoon and swallowed whole. Not “Oh – great! You should go do your thing, and best of luck (because honestly, you’ll need it since you’re about to fall flat on your face!)” encouragement, but the kind that is real, trustworthy, and rooted in deep experience.","link":"http://www.toddhenry.com/noticing/it-was-beautiful-a-brief-recap-of-wds-2013/","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/651826957961658368/d1MC9wtL.jpg","path":"todd__henry"},{"name":"Torea Rodriguez","content":"I go each year to the World Domination Summit so that I can be pushed just outside of my comfort zone, to get out of any ruts that I might be in and to kickstart me into thinking differently.","link":"","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/763604952207937536/uUQT_rLr.jpg","path":"torea__rodriguez"}]});
