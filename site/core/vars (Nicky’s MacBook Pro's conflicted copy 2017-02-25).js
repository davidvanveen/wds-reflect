I have a notebook full of quotes and ah-has from the weekend, but what I experienced was belonging. It was someone buying me a donut without me asking. It was dancing like a full-out goober with a couple hundred people. It was knowing shared laughter at things you know other people just wouldn't get. It was happily sharing meals with people who would not otherwise spend time together. It was 1,000 people standing in unison, without hesitation, when asked to donate their birthdays to charity. It was insta-friend. Just because you were there. When was the last time you truly felt like you belonged?","link":"http://www.withlaurasimms.com/blog/world-domination-summit-a-moment-you-missed","photo":"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/565aee11e4b06b23bf2b35da/t/565d8cd3e4b04b21693479e9/1448971476880/Career+Coach+Laura+Simms?format=500w","path":"laura__simms"},{"name":"Rita Chand","content":"The first time I attended WDS, I did so because a friend called me and said, \"Rita, you have to go to this thing.\" So I bought a ticket. Best. Thing. Ever. People are always talking about \"finding their tribe\" and I never fully understood what that meant until I attended my first event in 2012. These are definitely my people. My friends. My cheerleaders. My wind. WDS has changed my life, by not only bringing so many amazing, world do-gooders into my world, but also by making it so that no matter what i do, or say or declare, my fellow WDSers have my back. It's the only place I can go and feel like a superhero 24/7. It's uncommon to have a world that believes in you as much as WDS folks believe in each other. We help make each other's dreams come true. I am grateful to have found them.","link":"","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/824310763284070400/G-zWrrIY.jpg","path":"rita__chand"},{"name":"Sara Frandina","content":"WDS is exhilarating.

The beauty of WDS isn’t the programming, or the venues (which are amazing), or the “networking” like at most conferences. The beauty is that there are several thousand people all gathered in one place, centered on one ideal. The encouragement could be scooped out of the air with a spoon and swallowed whole. Not “Oh – great! You should go do your thing, and best of luck (because honestly, you’ll need it since you’re about to fall flat on your face!)” encouragement, but the kind that is real, trustworthy, and rooted in deep experience.","link":"http://www.toddhenry.com/noticing/it-was-beautiful-a-brief-recap-of-wds-2013/","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/651826957961658368/d1MC9wtL.jpg","path":"todd__henry"},{"name":"Torea Rodriguez","content":"I go each year to the World Domination Summit so that I can be pushed just outside of my comfort zone, to get out of any ruts that I might be in and to kickstart me into thinking differently.","link":"","photo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/763604952207937536/uUQT_rLr.jpg","path":"torea__rodriguez"}],"twitter":[[{"tweet":"My brain is seriously just exploding with all the amazing people I have met so far at #WDS2016.","tweeter":"anthonyongaro","tweeter_img":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/762173121403072513/HSSTtdN-.jpg"},{"tweet":"Loving how my home state of Colorado is representing at #WDS2016!!","tweeter":"tammigaw","tweeter_img":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/723254808833085441/O1KTbCCu.jpg"},{"tweet":"I love @jonathanfields's energy and body of work; happy to be present for his talk at #WDS2016 on what he's learned about living a good life.","tweeter":"SolSoloncha","tweeter_img":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/459387385784987648/ppDB1zLi.png"},{"tweet":"We're only alone when we choose to be.

His enthusiasm was immediate. Equipped with several sets of millstones from an old North Carolina water- powered flour mill, Bob and his wife, Charlee, began their first mill in Redding, California.\nAfter a few years, they decided to pursue others interests and retired to Oregon City, Oregon in 1978. On an afternoon walk, Bob came across an old mill that, as luck would have it, had a big sign out front reading “for sale”. In just a few short months, he was grinding flours and cereals for local customers. Bob spent many years growing the business, which is currently located in Milwaukie, Oregon in a 320,000 square foot facility covering some seventeen acres and producing thousands of products.\nBob’s 81st birthday was particularly special. Rather than receiving gifts, he decided to give his greatest gift away—his business.
