    ### What is WDS?{'\n'}

    The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting people from all over the world. Every summer, thousands of people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience in life, work, and travel.{'\n'}
    The weekend consists of three primary activities: main-stage events with keynote speakers that are attended by the entire group, workshops that focus on specific topics, and lots of meetups, parties, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is an introvert-friendly zone, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.{'\n'}
    <p>WDS was founded by <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com" target="blank">Chris Guillebeau</a>, explorer of the world and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The $100 Startup</i>.</p>

    ### Can I nominate myself or someone I represent to be a speaker?{'\n'}

    We're sure that you or your client would be great! But we do not accept nominations for speakers. Everyone who attends WDS is a big part of everything. Current year speakers are nominated by alumni speakers from previous years.{'\n'}

    ### Can I sponsor WDS or donate something for your attendees?{'\n'}

    WDS is a sponsor-free, non-commercial gathering. We do not accept advertising or sponsored products.{'\n'}

    ### Can I be a volunteer?{'\n'}
    Every year we recruit a number of volunteer "ambassadors" to serve our attendees during WDS. To apply for this role, you must live in Portland at least most of the year, and you must be available during the entire weekend of the event. Applications will open after ticket sales end. When applications become available, Chris will make an announcement on his <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/">blog</a> and through <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisguillebeau">Twitter.</a>

    ### How can I get a ticket?{'\n'}

    Tickets for WDS are only offered a couple of times a year, and they go quickly. There is no fast-track or secret process to get a ticket; they are all offered on a first-come, first-served basis. The best way to be notified when tickets go on sale is to join the 2017 <a href="http://worlddominationsummit.com/register">waiting list.</a>
    Please note: Once tickets are gone, they're gone. We do not hold any tickets back for higher-priced sales later, nor do we sell tickets at the door.

    ### What is the refund/exchange policy on WDS tickets?
    All WDS tickets (360 and Connect) are non-refundable.
    **For WDS 360:** Transfers and name changes are available for a $100 fee from February until May 10th (60 days prior to WDS) and a $200 fee from May 11th until June 10th (30 days prior to WDS). Starting **June 11th, 2017**, no further transfers or name changes will be possible.
     **For WDS Connect:** There are no transfers or name changes for WDS Connect tickets.

    ### How can I transfer a 360 ticket?

    (Starting in mid-February) Ticket holders can transfer their ticket by:
    1. Logging into your WDS account and looking for the transfer link at the bottom of the page 
    2. Contacting our concierge team at <a href="mailto:concierge@wds.fm">concierge@wds.fm</a>
