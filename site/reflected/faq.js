    ### What is WDS?{'\n'}

    The World Domination Summit (WDS) is a gathering of creative, interesting people from all over the world. Every summer, thousands of people travel to Portland, Oregon for an immersive experience in life, work, and travel.{'\n'}
    The weekend consists of three primary activities: main-stage events with keynote speakers that are attended by the entire group, workshops that focus on specific topics, and lots of meetups, parties, and informal engagement. Despite the large number of people who attend, WDS is introvert-friendly, and everyone who participates is a big part of the event.{'\n'}
    <p>WDS was founded by <Link to="http://chrisguillebeau.com" target="blank">Chris Guillebeau</Link>, explorer of the world and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The $100 Startup</i>.</p>

    ### Can I nominate myself or someone I represent to be a speaker?{'\n'}

    We're sure that you or your client would be great! But we do not accept nominations for speakers. Everyone who attends WDS is a big part of everything. Current year speakers are nominated by alumni speakers from previous years.{'\n'}

    ### Can I sponsor WDS or donate something for your attendees?{'\n'}

    WDS is a sponsor-free, non-commercial gathering. We do not accept advertising or sponsored products.{'\n'}

    ### Can I be a volunteer?{'\n'}
    <p>Every year we recruit a number of volunteer "ambassadors" to serve our attendees during WDS. To apply for this role, you must live in Portland at least most of the year (or have extensive knowledge of the city) and you must be available during the entire weekend for WDS main-events. Special consideration is given to those that are available for the entire week of WDS. Applications are typically available 3-4 months prior to WDS. When applications become available, Chris will make an announcement on his <Link to="http://chrisguillebeau.com/">blog</Link> and through <Link to="https://twitter.com/chrisguillebeau">Twitter.</Link></p>

    ### How can I get a ticket?{'\n'}

    <p>Tickets for WDS are only offered a couple of times a year, and they go quickly. There is no fast-track or secret process to get a ticket; they are all offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Once tickets are gone, they're gone. We do not hold any tickets back for higher-priced sales later, nor do we sell tickets at the door.</p>
